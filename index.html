          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Akira Kurosawa (Japanese: 黒澤 明, Hepburn: Kurosawa Akira, March
            23, 1910 - September 6, 1998) was a Japanese filmmaker and painter
            who directed 30 films in a career spanning over five decades. He is
            widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential
            filmmakers in the history of cinema. Kurosawa displayed a bold,
            dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet distinct
            from it; he was involved with all aspects of film production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a
            brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films
            as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a
            director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro
            Sugata (1943). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel
            (1948), in which Kurosawa cast the then little-known actor Toshiro
            Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one
            of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would
            go on to collaborate on another fifteen films.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rashomon (1950), which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise
            winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. The
            commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film
            markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film
            industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other
            Japanese filmmakers. Kurosawa directed approximately one film per
            year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, including a number of
            highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as Ikiru (1952),
            Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), Yojimbo (1961) and
            High and Low (1963). After the 1960s he became much less prolific;
            even so, his later work—including two of his final films, Kagemusha
            (1980) and Ran (1985)—continued to receive great acclaim.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement.
            Posthumously, he was named "Asian of the Century" in the "Arts,
            Literature, and Culture" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN,
            cited there as being among the five people who most prominently
            contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His
            career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and
            biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many
            consumer media.
